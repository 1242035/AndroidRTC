# AndroidRTC

## WebRTC Live Streaming

- an Android client for [ProjectRTC](https://github.com/pchab/ProjectRTC)

## How to

- Launch the app
- Choose your config and share your stream
- If you chose to make a private stream, only those who have the correct link will see the stream
- If you chose to make a public stream, the stream will be visible at 54.214.218.3:3000

If you can't compile it yet, you can still download the apk [here](https://github.com/pchab/ProjectRTC/raw/master/AndroidRTC.apk).

## Libraries

- [libjingle peerconnection](https://code.google.com/p/libjingle/)
- [android-websockets](https://github.com/koush/android-websockets)

If you want to use them in your project, I recommend working with IntelliJ IDEA :

- Start a new android application project
- Add the .jar and .so in the libs folder
- Right-click "add as library"
