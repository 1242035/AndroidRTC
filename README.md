# ProjectRTC

## WebRTC Live Streaming

- a very simple Android client for [ProjectRTC](https://github.com/pchab/ProjectRTC)

## Libraries

- [libjingle peerconnection](https://code.google.com/p/libjingle/)
- [android-websockets](https://github.com/koush/android-websockets)

If you want to use them in your project, I recommend working with IntelliJ IDEA :

- Start a new android application project
- Add the .jar in the libs folder
- Right-click "add as library"

I tried Eclipse and Android Studio but this is just much easier.
